# Coding workflow

Carry one requested change from plan to a pull request. Each step ends on its **Done when**; reach it before moving on.

A **loop-back** sends feedback to the TDD step (4.1) and resumes the workflow from there. Carry the feedback that triggered it into TDD as the work to address.

## 0. Preflight

- If the project has no `verify-code` skill, stop. Tell the user to run the `setup-code-quality-assurance` Playbook from the `TClark1011/personal-ai-setup` repository first, or to continue without the verify step (4.2), and wait for their choice.
- If the working tree has uncommitted changes, ask the user to commit or stash them first, or to continue anyway.

**Done when** the user has answered every question this step raised.

## 1. Grill

Invoke the `grilling` and `domain-modeling` skills and follow both together.

As the design settles, judge whether the work splits into **phases**: parts so distinct and separate that each deserves its own commit. Offer multiple phases only with considerable justification; the default is one phase and one commit.

**Done when** the grilling is complete and the user has confirmed the shared understanding, including the phases if you offered them.

## 2. Branch

Find the project's **Dev Branch**: the branch all new changes are merged into first. It is often the default branch, but some projects keep production on the default branch and merge new work into a separate branch first. Infer it from branch names and recent commit history (which branch feature branches merge into). If the evidence is ambiguous, ask the user.

Create a new branch off the Dev Branch, named from what the grilling settled. Follow the project's branch naming convention (from `AGENTS.md`, contributing docs or recent branch names), or `<conventional-commit-type>/<short-slug>` when there is none.

**Done when** the new branch is checked out.

## 3. Spec

Write `.scratch/<branch-name>.md`: the requirements the grilling settled, and the phases if there are several. If the work came from a ticket one of your tools can reach, the ticket is the primary spec and the file adds what the grilling settled on top of it.

**Done when** the spec file exists.

## 4. Per phase

Run 4.1 to 4.4 once per phase, in order.

### 4.1 TDD

Invoke the `test-driven-development` skill and implement the phase. On a loop-back, address exactly the feedback carried in.

**Done when** the `test-driven-development` skill's **Done when** holds.

### 4.2 Verify

Dispatch a sub-agent on the fastest model your harness offers (in Claude Code: `haiku`). Its brief:

- Run the `verify-code` skill, skipping the test command, with these overrides:
  - Run the Tidy fix command, and keep its fixes.
  - If the Tidy fix command changed any files, run the full test suite as well.
  - Report every other failure instead of fixing it. Edit no files.
  - For each conflict (where fixing one failure would cause another), name it and suggest the way out the `verify-code` skill gives.
- Report pass or fail, with each failure's command, location and output excerpt.

On any failure, loop back with the report.

**Done when** the sub-agent reports a pass.

### 4.3 Review

Invoke the `code-review` skill on the uncommitted changes, passing the spec file from step 3. Handle its findings by **class**:

| Axis      | Hard violation                                  | Judgement call              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Standards | hard violations                                 | judgement calls             |
| Security  | HIGH confidence findings                        | MEDIUM "needs verification" |
| Spec      | (a) missing or partial, (c) implemented wrongly | (b) scope creep             |

- **Any hard violation**: loop back automatically with the hard violations alone, plus any conflicts that involve them. Leave the judgement calls; the next review raises them again.
- **Judgement calls only**: show them to the user and ask which to address. Loop back with the user's picks; the rest are let go.

**Done when** a review has no hard violations, and the user has either picked no judgement calls or there were none.

### 4.4 Commit

Commit the phase's changes, excluding the spec file, with a message in the project's commit convention (Conventional Commits where a `commit-msg` hook enforces it).

**Done when** the commit exists.

## 5. Final review

Only when there were several phases. Invoke the `code-review` skill on the changes since the Dev Branch as its fixed point, passing the spec file. Handle findings as in 4.3, except a loop-back here runs 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4, then returns to this step.

**Done when** the same bar as 4.3 is met across all the changes.

## 6. Push and PR

Push the branch and open a pull request against the Dev Branch, ready for review. Its description holds the spec file's contents. Then delete the spec file.

**Done when** the pull request is open and the spec file is gone.

## Loop-back cap

After 3 automatic loop-backs in a row from the same step, stop. Show the user the remaining issues and ask whether to continue, change the plan, or accept them. The count resets when the user decides.
